# CharitableVisualizations

Thus repository contains Power BI, Tableau, and Python (and Seaborn) code for visualizing a sample charitable data set.
The input data set is synthesized but realistic (it matches what I have seen in an internship)
and is large (70,000 donor records). It can be used by others as a publicly available benchmark as there
us nothing proprietary about the synthesized data.

The current code is more about visual analytics but in the future I will add some machine learning
results as well using the Weka tool set that I have done (in my experience, simple decision trees
work well)

Even in terms of visual analytics, there are three different tools that are commonly used: Power BI (which
I have the most experience with), Tableau, and Python.  While Python has the most power, it is easier to do
most visualiizations and build dashboards using Power BI and Tableau.  The repository has Power BI, Tableau 
and Python code for visualizations of the charitable data set.  Python's Seaborn is paricularly nice at
some visualizations (e.g., complex heat maps) which may require specialized code using AppSource in Power BI

Feel free to play with the code and the data set, and contact me at timothyvarghese@g.ucla.edu if I can help
you with any visualizations or analytics needs for your charitable organization.
